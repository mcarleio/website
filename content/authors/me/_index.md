Hi! My name is Marcel, I am a passionate all-round Java developer, with a focus on backend. I enjoy developing software and am curious by nature for anything around the development process.

Over the last years I have worked with various frameworks and technologies in the backend (Spring Boot, JEE, OSGi, ...) and frontend (Angular, JSF, Vaadin, ...) area.<br>
I designed and developed interfaces with SOAP, JMS, and REST and worked with relational databases like Oracle, PostgreSQL, Derby, H2, and MariaDB. But I also used NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Neo4j, and Redis.

Recently, I came across cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud and passed the exam as a certified AWS Solutions Architect! With the help of Terraform, I learned (and {{< icon name="heart" pack="fas" >}}) defining IaaS.

I am using tools like JIRA, Confluence, GitLab, Jenkins, Nexus, and Docker to organize, document, support, and simplify the development process.

Already during my dual Bachelor studies I implemented various software projects myself and successfully published a few.
Later on, at the beginning of my Master studies, I co-founded a company ([Bontoo Mobile Development UG](#experience)) with some friends which focused on B2B mobile apps with backend services.

I gained a lot of experience through my work as a software developer and my studies. However, my own projects taught me much deeper understanding and practical skills!
Besides bigger private projects like [Cryptonify](/project/cryptonify), a platform-independent password manager,
or [GetFav](/project/getfav), a service to obtain the favicons for any arbitrary webpage,
I am also developing open source libraries like [Strix](/project/strix) and [Sciurus](/project/sciurus).
