# Abstract.
abstract = "Cryptonify puts an end to lost or forgotten access data for web services and frees you of exuberant trails of paperwork for usernames and passwords. The Java program is very well conceived and works quickly and stably. The program interface is clearly arranged and can also be operated without time-consuming training. Extensive documentation for almost every menu item eliminates ambiguities to a great extent. Thus, you no longer have any excuse to use web services with insecure access data or even using the same access data everywhere."
