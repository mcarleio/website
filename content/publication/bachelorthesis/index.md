abstract: This thesis describes the development of a Java EE application and the optimization of individual processes of this software. Used technologies, interfaces and the structure of the software, as well as the data base, are exemplarily presented and partly illustrated with examples. After the background has been sufficiently presented, individual exemplary implementations and optimizations that have been implemented in the software will be discussed.
