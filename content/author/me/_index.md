Hi! My name is Marcel and I enjoy engineering and developing software and using new tools in the IT area.

Already during my dual Bachelor studies I did various software projects myself and successfully published some of them.
Later on, at the beginning of my Master studies I co-founded a company with some friends in the area of developing B2B solutions for mobile devices.

I gained a lot of experience through my work and the studies, but my own projects taught me much deeper understanding and practical skills!
Besides bigger projects like [Cryptonify](/project/cryptonify) or [GetFav](/project/getfav), I also develop open source libraries like [Strix](/project/strix) and [Sciurus](/project/sciurus). 
There are many more smaller projects I implement, often for my personal use only:

I once used a Raspberry Pi and a 32x16 LED matrix and displayed incoming call notifications, the weather forecast and alike.
A few years ago I build a drone and while working on my flying abilities, I implemented some new ideas.
For my home automation I build a script for iobroker, so that I could control my TV with Amazon Alexa.
In my school time, I was maybe like 16 years old, I developed a small bot for Guild Wars, which sold all my crafting material over night, but only if the price was good.
And there are many more smaller projects...
