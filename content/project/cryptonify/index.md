Cryptonify is a platform independent password manager written in Java. It stores the entered data encrypted with AES-256 in a local file, which you may manually sync with your devices or use the included Dropbox sync feature.
You can even sync and manage your passwords on Android using the offical [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.marcelcarle.pwm.activities).

With the help of browser extensions, Cryptonify offers an integration into the most common browsers and e.g. have your username and password automatically entered into the designated form fields.
